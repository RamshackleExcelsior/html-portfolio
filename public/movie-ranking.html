<h1> The Best Movies According to Anthony </h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Trainspotting</h3>

<p>Even though the plot is depressing, there is a message of hope.</p>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>

<p>There seems to be a theme going on here about battling inner demons.</p>

<h3>Seven</h3>

<p>Yet another David Fincher movie on this list, he's just that good of a director.</p>
